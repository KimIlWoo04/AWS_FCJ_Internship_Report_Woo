# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1”

### Event Objectives

To provide a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to AWS's Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative AI services. The workshop aims to equip participants with a foundational understanding of the core platforms—Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock—enabling them to understand how to build, deploy, and scale intelligent solutions, with a specific focus on the practical application of Generative AI.

### Host

- **Kha Van** 

### Key Highlights

- **End-to-End ML Platform**: A deep dive into Amazon SageMaker, covering the entire ML lifecycle from data preparation and model training to deployment and MLOps.
- **Hands-On Generative AI**: Practical exploration of Amazon Bedrock, including access to leading foundation models (like Claude and Llama), advanced prompt engineering, and building a functional AI chatbot.
- **Architecting Intelligent Agents**: Learn to build sophisticated Bedrock Agents that can perform multi-step tasks and integrate with external tools and knowledge bases using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **Practical Demos & Safety**: Live walkthroughs of SageMaker Studio and a Generative AI chatbot, coupled with crucial guidance on implementing Guardrails for safe and responsible AI applications. 

### Key Takeaways

- **Actionable Knowledge of Core Services**: Understand the purpose and capabilities of Amazon SageMaker for traditional ML and Amazon Bedrock for Generative AI, and know when to use each.
- **Foundational Skills in Prompt Engineering**: Learn and apply key techniques like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning to effectively communicate with and control large language models.
- **Ability to Implement a RAG System**: Grasp the architecture for building Generative AI applications that can access and leverage your proprietary data, moving beyond generic chatbots to create specialized, knowledgeable assistants.
- **Awareness of the AI/ML Ecosystem**: Gain insights into the current AI/ML landscape in Vietnam and the tools available on AWS to innovate and build solutions responsibly and efficiently.
