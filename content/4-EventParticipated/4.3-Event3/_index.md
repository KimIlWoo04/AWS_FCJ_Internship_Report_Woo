# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2”

### Event Objectives

To provide a comprehensive, end-to-end understanding of the DevOps methodology and its practical implementation on AWS. This workshop is designed to equip developers and operations teams with the knowledge to build, deploy, and monitor scalable and reliable applications efficiently by leveraging AWS services for CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and observability.

### Host

- **Kha Van** 

### Key Highlights

- **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**: A deep dive into the AWS Developer Tools suite (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) to fully automate the software release process, including advanced deployment strategies like Blue/Green and Canary.
- **Mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Hands-on exploration of both declarative (AWS CloudFormation) and programmable (AWS CDK) approaches to defining and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Containerization & Microservices**: A practical guide to running containerized applications using Amazon ECS, EKS, and the simplified AWS App Runner, including image management with Amazon ECR.
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Learn to implement monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to gain - insights into application health and performance.
- **Real-World Best Practices**: Actionable insights from case studies covering deployment strategies, incident management, and the key metrics (DORA) for measuring DevOps success. 

### Key Takeaways

- **Ability to Automate a CI/CD Pipeline**: Understand how to assemble AWS services to create a fully automated, secure, and fast path from code commit to production deployment.
- **Practical Skills in Infrastructure as Code**: Gain the knowledge to choose and use CloudFormation or CDK to manage infrastructure reliably and efficiently.
- **Framework for Container Deployment**: Learn the core AWS container services and when to use ECS, EKS, or App Runner for your microservices architecture.
- **Strategy for Monitoring and Reliability**: Know how to set up a comprehensive observability system to proactively identify issues, troubleshoot performance bottlenecks, and improve application reliability.
